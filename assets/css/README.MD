# Creating a Portfolio

We were tasked with creating a portfolio from scratch. I started by creating files inside of my uniquely named folder, Student Portfolio. I created an HTML file, 3 CSS files, and a .gitignore file. I then added a folder for images that I had locally stored in my own personal library. I used the .gitignore to hide files from github that did not need to be seen by the public. 

## Creating the Content in HTML

I wrote code to match the example portfolio that we were given. I created a nav bar that had three links: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. 

I then added content into each of the sections including a description of myself and a photo of myself, an example of one of the applications I made, and then my contact information.

### Make it Look Nice

After my content was created in the HTML file, I went to my CSS folders and started to add detail and spacing to my HTML elements. I added color, borders, margins and more.
