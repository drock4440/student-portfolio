# Creating a Portfolio

We were tasked with creating a portfolio from scratch. I started by creating files inside of my uniquely named folder, Student Portfolio. I created an HTML file, 3 CSS files, and a .gitignore file. I then added a folder for images that I had locally stored in my own personal library. I used the .gitignore to hide files from github that did not need to be seen by the public. 

## Creating the Content in HTML

I wrote code to match the example portfolio that we were given. I created a nav bar that had three links: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. 

I then added content into each of the sections including a description of myself and a photo of myself, an example of one of the applications I made, and then my contact information.

### Make it Look Nice

After my content was created in the HTML file, I went to my CSS folders and started to add detail and spacing to my HTML elements. I added color, borders, margins and more. 

#### Adding it all to Github

I already had a repository established for this assignment and linked to my Github page. THe only thing left to do was to push my final page to Github and post my page to live.
